In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with `NSManagedObjectContext` and its concurrency features.  Specifically, attempting to perform operations on a context from a thread other than the one it was created on can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior. This is because `NSManagedObjectContext` is not inherently thread-safe.

For example:

```objectivec
// Incorrect: Accessing the context from a background thread
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
    [self.managedObjectContext save:nil]; // Crash likely here
});
```

The issue stems from the context's internal state and the way it interacts with Core Data's underlying mechanisms.  Accessing and modifying it concurrently can cause data corruption, race conditions, or even application crashes.
